#Introduction

In order to test terraform we will need one of the providers. Here we are going to see how terraform works with Azure provider so we need a subscription id for that.

## Create free account

We will create a free azure account and us the subscription id for further understanding terraform.

Microsoft Azure offers a free 30-day trial period to all new account holders.

Go to https://www.azure.com and click the green “Start free” button.

You’ll also need to supply a valid credit card. Prepaid credit cards won’t work — you’ll need a “normal” credit or debit card. There is no charge involved with the setting up of a trial account. Microsoft just wants to see your card to verify your identity. 

Once your account is created you can access the Microsoft Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com/

# Introduction

Here you will learn about one of the IAC tool Terraform

## What is Terraform
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.It is developed by HashiCorp. It allows defining the Infrastructure as Code with minimum human interaction.

Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries etc.

## Why Terraform

1. Terraform lets you define infrastructure in code and will enable you to change and track changes to infrastructure with ease.

2. Terraform enables you to implement all kinds of coding principles like having your code in source control, the ability to write automated tests, etc

3. Terraform is the right tool for infrastructure management as many other tools have a severe impedance mismatch from trying to wrangle an API designed for configuring management to control an infrastructure environment. Instead, Terraform matches correctly with what you want to do- the API aligns with the way you think about infrastructure.

4. Terraform has a lively community and is open source.

5. Terraform’s speed and operations are exceptional. One cool thing about Terraform is, it’s plan command lets you see what changes you’re about to apply before you apply them.

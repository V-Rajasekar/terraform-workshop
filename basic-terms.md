# Introduction

Here we are going to understand the basic terminology that we are going to use throughout the session.

### Resource Group

A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group.

### Resource

A manageable item that is available through Azure. Virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks are examples of resources. Resource groups, subscriptions, management groups, and tags are also examples of resources.

### Virtual Network

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. 

### Virtual Machine

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. In azure terms it could be a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer.
